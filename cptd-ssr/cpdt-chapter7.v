Variable A : Type.


(*

This is a suggested way to defined the computation. 
To my taste, it has a number of disadvantages:

- Constructor uses default name rather than a meaningful one;
- You can define no coresion from the DT to a function f;
- You are constrantly force to use projections (e.g., proj1_sig) insead of relyin to the coercion;

(* 

[Remark 1448:]

Setting these implicit arguments is important: otherwise it will not
be easy to use Fix in the two exmaples below. The heurisitics of Coq
works in the way that it starts unifying the frist arguments, which
doesn't depend on anything. 

This leads to the problem that the argument of Fix (the function) is
being unified with the proof of its continuity. In order to avoid
this, we use the following pragma to specify which arguments should be
considered implicit. The others should be mentioned explicitly.

(***********************************************************************

Lessons learned:
----------------

1. First, we defined basic operations and shoed how to run them within
a liminted number of steps.

2. Then, we defined partial order on partially defined functions and a
notion of continuity (f_cont). 

3. We have shown that thefixed point can be defined for the limited
"fuel" (n) and proved it to be reachable (Lemma Fix'_ok). That is, if
the fixpoint is instantiated with enough fuel, it will terminate.  The
notion of continuity was crucial in order to prove Fix'_ok, which was
later employed for construction of the Fix computation and proving
that it "saturates" for a particular n.

4. The computation wrapper Fix provides exactly the amount of fuel
(which mich or might be not enough for termination). In order to run
the program, we need to provied the amount of fuel by hand.

5. Defining recursive functions amounts to proving continuity of their
arguments.

6. The crux of the development is a well-formed recursive function
Fix' that takes a number of steps to execute. 

7. It is important that the computations are *constructed* by means of
shallow embedding, but not *run*: in order to do it, we need to
provide enough "fuel".

8. Use new constructros instead of the embedded refined time: it
enables coercions and improves your karma and libido.

--------
Homework
--------

- Can it be used in order to implement the fixed-point iteration in
  abstract interpretation? Does one need to construct the termination
  argument?

- How to formulate the questions to the abstract interpreter?
